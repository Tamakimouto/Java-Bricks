Mock Ups for the game

_____________________________________________________________________

Start Screen:
http://puu.sh/dloj3/b2043c9fb9.jpg

This is for extra credit, I'll have the blinking start
text on there, I'll try to play it out so that the game 
flows nicely. I'll have some background music and everything.

I don't know how I came up with this, I'll make it work.

_____________________________________________________________________

During the Game:
http://puu.sh/dlp8y/9e7dee9066.png

I'll have the bricks change color when the ball hits them
I may or may not add a nicer background, right now I don't 
know what I'm going to do with it. The bricks might also be 
arranged differently to give it a nicer feel. I might draw 
some picture with the bricks. For now I don't really know.
I'll come up with it as I work.

______________________________________________________________________

Game Over:
http://puu.sh/dlpRz/a2f124626a.png

This is the game over text, It'll display when the user drops
the ball for the 3rd time, and when teh life count at the
top of the previous screen reaches 0. I'll have some motivational
text as to not discourage the user, and coerce them into
playing again. along with the final score of the User.

_______________________________________________________________________

Game Won:
http://puu.sh/dlq6l/6f248f8287.png

This will be displayed once the user has killed all the bricks.
I was thinking about it, and I decided that I won't have a level 
system. That's not how you make a fun game, unless there is a final
level. I'll make this game difficult enough, to where a level system
is absurd. I think that in a game with endless levels, there's no 
incentive to continue playing the game. 

Now, I don't know if I'm going to keep this Win Screen, 
I need to think about that.

My program will defenitly look different from this mockup, in fact
since I'm working alone, I question the need for a mockup. I'll just 
come up with a UI design as I make the UI. The bricks will defenitly look 
different. The Start scree should have the enter text, and the Win/Lose
Screens may or may not look different. Forgive the spelling errors I may have
in this. I hope you like the game.
